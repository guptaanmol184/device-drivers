List of important files and paths in linux:
-------------------------------------------

Important paths (directories):

/* CORE DIRECTORIES */
/ : Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.
/bin : Essential command binaries that need to be available in single user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp.
/boot : Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.
/dev : device files, e.g., /dev/null, /dev/disk0, /dev/sda1, /dev/tty, /dev/random.
/etc : Host-specific system-wide configuration files
    /etc/opt : Configuration files for add-on packages that are stored in /opt.
    /etc/fonts : Fonts configuration files on the system.
    /etc/grub.d : Grub configuration files.
    /etc/X11 : Configuration files for the X Window System, version 11.
    /etc/sgml : Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes SGML.
    /etc/xml : Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes XML.
/home : Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.
/lib : Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin and /sbin.
/lib<qual> : Alternative format essential libraries. Such directories are optional, but if they exist, they have some requirements.
/media : Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs.
/mnt : Temporarily mounted filesystems.
/opt : Optional application software packages.
/proc : Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.
/root : Home directory for the root user.
/run : Run-time variable data: Information about the running system since last boot, e.g., currently logged-in users and running daemons. Files under this directory must be either removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process; but this is not necessary on systems that provide this directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs).
/sbin : Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.
/srv : Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems.
/sys : Contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.
/tmp : Temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted.
/usr : Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.
    /usr/bin : Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single user mode); for all users.
    /usr/include : Standard include files.
    /usr/lib : Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
    /usr/lib<qual> : Alternative format libraries, e.g. /usr/lib32 for 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit machine (optional).
    /usr/local : Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host. Typically has further subdirectories, e.g., bin, lib, share.
    /usr/sbin : Non-essential system binaries, e.g., daemons for various network-services.
    /usr/share : Architecture-independent (shared) data.
    /usr/src : Source code, e.g., the kernel source code with its header files.
    /usr/X11R6 : X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (up to FHS-2.3, optional).
/var : Variable files—files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system—such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.
    /var/cache : Application cache data. Such data are locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. The cached files can be deleted without loss of data.
    /var/lib : State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run, e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc.
    /var/lock : Lock files. Files keeping track of resources currently in use.
    /var/log : Log files. Various logs.
    /var/mail : Mailbox files. In some distributions, these files may be located in the deprecated /var/spool/mail.
    /var/opt : Variable data from add-on packages that are stored in /opt.
    /var/run : Run-time variable data. This directory contains system information data describing the system since it was booted.
    /var/spool : Spool for tasks waiting to be processed, e.g., print queues and outgoing mail queue.
        /var/spool/mail : Deprecated location for users' mailboxes.
    /var/tmp : Temporary files to be preserved between reboots.


/* EXTRA */
/etc/init.d : Service startup Script.
/etc/rc.d : Information about run level specific script.
/etc/rc.d/init.d : Run Level Initialisation Script.
/etc/profile.d : Application script, executed after login.
/etc/X11 : Configuration files of X-window System.


Important files:
